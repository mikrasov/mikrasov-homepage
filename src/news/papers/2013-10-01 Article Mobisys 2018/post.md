Our review of **[MobiSys 2013](/papers/Nekrasov_2013_10_MobiSys.pdf)** was published in Journal of *IEEE Pervasive Computing*.

The 11th International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services (MobiSys 2013) was held June 25th through the 28th in Taipei, Taiwan. Hosted in Asia for the first time, the event attracted over 200 attendees, with 57 percent of the participants coming from Asian institutions (33 percent were from North America and 7 percent were from Europe). This three-day event featured 33 papers, 18 posters, 15 demos, and a first-time video track with 14 videos.
 
After 10 successful years of showcasing cutting-edge academic and industrial research in mobile technology, this year’s MobiSys introduced a new panel, “The Untold Stories of Research.” The panel facilitated a lively discussion on topics related to the life of research projects after they appear in an academic publication. In addition, MobiSys continued to bridge industry and research with its Industry Panel. This year’s panel featured two Taiwan-based world leaders in the field of mobile communications—HTC and MediaTek—and provided insight into Taiwan’s perspective on the future of mobile communications.

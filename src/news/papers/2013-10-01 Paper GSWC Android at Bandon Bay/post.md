I presented our work: **[Android at Bandon Bay: Low-Cost Environmental Monitoring and Event Detection Using Smartphones](/papers/Nekrasov_2013_10_Android_Bandon_Bay.pdf)** at the *Graduate Student Workshop on Computing* at UCSB, Santa Barbara.

Our work builds on open source technologies and standards to provide a system for real-time event detection in Bandon Bay, Thailand. Our system leverages the availability and versatility of mobile devices for effective low-cost monitoring in a region that is devoid of power and is prone to frequent cellular disruptions.

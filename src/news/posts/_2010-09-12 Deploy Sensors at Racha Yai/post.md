In October 2010, members of the OSDT Initiative collaborated with members of the Coral Reef Environmental Observatory Network (CREON, www.coralreefeon.org) to enhance the cyberinfrastructure at Racha Island Thailand. The collaboration included members from the Center of Excellence of Ecoinformatics, Walailak University, the Great Barrier Reef Ocean Observing System (GBROOS, www.imos.org.au/gbroos.html), and our group at Calit2, UCSD. As part of this project, a SBE-37IM CTD that measures conductivity, temperature, and depth was deployed on the fringing reef at approximately 10 m water depth with 5 min sampling frequency. The deployment uses inductive coupling technology to send the data back to the station on the shore. A 350 m mourning cable runs from shore to the CTD, secured at 10 m intervals by 3 kg cinder bricks. The CTD is connected to the mooring cable via an inductive modem connection. This sensor deployment was interfaced to a shore-side DataTurbine server to manage the real-time data streams. Researcher associated with this project will present their results at the next CREON workshop to be held in Brisbane Australia on 10 Dec 2010.

As part of my work with the Coral Reef Observation Network, I visited with the [Great Barrier Reef Ocean Observing System - GBROOS](https://apps.aims.gov.au/metadata/view/506788a0-0b4e-11dd-9669-00008a07204e) from the Australian Institute of Marine Science.

I went out on one of their research vessels to a marine sensor network deployed on the Great Barrier Reef. There I helped with maintenance and learned about their network configuration and how they deploy their sensors.

Thank you so much to the GBROOS team for hosting me.

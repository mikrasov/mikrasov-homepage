My labmate Danny and I visited the [Internet Freedom Festival](https://internetfreedomfestival.org/) in Valencia, Spain. We shared our work on [SecurePost](https://www.securepost.co/) and learned about other work in the area of Free Speech Online.

The festival was structured with multiple parallel sessions of varying formats, from lectures, to group discussions, hands-on workshops. The participants ranged from developers, trainers, ngo representatives, activists, journalists, to unaffiliated attendees interested in security and internet freedom. During the conference we had many opportunities to share our app, and get some great feedback.

We had a rather exciting holiday season, which unfortunately resulted in a deficit of photography.
My whole family got together in San Diego for the holidays. My mother in law, Christmas eve came down with a Gall Bladder
stone resulting in us rushing her to the ER. They performed surgery the following morning (Christmas Day) resulting in a bit of
unplanned chaos. She is fine, just had to watch her diet a bit more.

Aside from medical drama, I always appreciate being back in San Diego to spend time with my extended family (including friends I have had for decades).

I am honored to have been selected to receive the BAE Systems Scholarship for 2009. 

This scholarship was established to recognize academic excellence and provide financial support to students majoring in
computer science, applied mathematics, or computer or electrical engineering, and who plan to pursue a career in San Diego.

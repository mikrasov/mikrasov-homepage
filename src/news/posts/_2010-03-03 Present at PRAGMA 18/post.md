In summer 2009, OSDT Initiative mentored two undergraduate students through NSF-sponsored PRIME (Pacific RIM undergraduate Experience: prime.ucsd.edu/) program. Brian McMahon worked on integrating DataTurbine into the tsunami warning system in partnership with researchers at the University of Hyderabad, India. Michael Nekrasov worked on integrating DataTurbine into an underwater infrared and fluorescence camera system in partnership with National Center for High-Performance Computing (NCHC), Taiwan. These two students submitted a poster [1] to PRAGMA 18 workshop. The poster was peer-reviewed by the Poster Committee and was accepted for presentation on March 3, 2010. This gave the students an opportunity to interact with PRAGMA participants from around the world, share their experiences and discuss potential collaborations.
